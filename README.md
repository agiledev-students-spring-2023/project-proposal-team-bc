## Collaboration

TBD

## Project title

Mediapedia

## What and why?

There are many times when people are bored without anything to read or watch. They often look to google or friends and family for recommendations. However, this project aims streamline this process. Upload movies, tv shows, or book description to review or share it with the community. Recommend a work to the community or friends as well as write your own review. Add what you are currently watching or reading for others to see and join discussions about anything interesting. With this app, people will be more in touch with each other and have an easier time knowing how to spend their free time.

## For whom?

Friends, families, enthusiast, book readers, movie/show watchers

Anyone who is looking for a good show to binge on Netflix or book to read on their commute. In addition to film or book enthusiast, friends might be interested in knowing what their family or friends are up to and what they recommend. Critics might even be interested by giving their recommendations for the public and review books or movies.

## How?

Login/register to keep track of individual user information. Search for a specific movie or book to like/comment/review on or add a movie if it hasn't appeared in the community yet. To let your friends know what you are up to, you can add books or movies to your book list or movie list. Share a book or movie that you think is particularly good through posts with the ability to like and comment. There could even be discussions about a specific work.

## Scope

It might be a bit ambitious depending on what functionalities are going to be implemented. The essential functionalities are reviewing and sharing books and movies. Optional functionalities would be liking, commenting, and anything else that improves a post. To really improve the projects, images would most likely be needed as users should be able to upload and store movie posters or book covers. Storing images might be a challenge.
